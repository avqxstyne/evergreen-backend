Throughout history, there have been countless schemes for world domination. From massive conquests like those of Ancient Rome and Greece, 
to more modern ones such has the efforts of the British Empire, to the Chinese control of the world 30 years from now. But one conquest,
if it can be called one, has made it much further than any of these in its control of the world. The scariest part is that it's not even 
a country or government entity. On top of that, most people have never heard of it. Henry Kissinger once said that whoever
controls the money controls the world.

Let me introduce you to BlackRock

Let's start with some background:
The key man in this story is Larry Fink. Born on November 2, 1952, Fink was raised in an avergae home. But he quickly
began to climb the ranks of the world, earning a BA in political science and MBA in real estate in his early 20s. Soon enough though, 
he began to realize that money, not politics, is not where the power lies.
He started his career in 1976 at First Boston, a New-York based investment bank, where was one of the first 
mortgage-backed security traders ever. Fink was by far First Boston's most profitable employee, adding around 1 billion
dollars to the company's bottom line in less than a decade. He was on track to possibly even become CEO until 1986, when Larry made a small mistake.
He lost the company 100 million dollars through an incorrect prediction.
Now while this caused First Boston to get him out of there without a second thought, it also inspired his future business ideas 
centered around risk management. With this in mind, Fink formulated a plan. After contacting some old connections, Fink founded
risk management and investment company Blackrock. Under the wing of a 5 million dollar credit line from The Blackstone Group, BlackRock
turned that 5 million dollars into 8 billion dollars in only a few years.

At this point, they were clearly a profitable business and decided to go public. The split apart from parent company Blackstone, 
and the firm officialy adopted the name BlackRock. In Fink's conquest for more power, he pressured one of the co-founders into 
selling his shares of the company for 250 million, which would now be worth over 12b. This co-founder, Stephen Schwarzman, called this his 'Heroic Mistake'.
By the end of 1992, only 4 years from it's creation, BlackRock was managing 17b dollars in assets. 2 years after that, they were managing 53b, and
Fink was the CEO and chairman of BlackRock Inc.

With background out of the way, let's take a look the corruption and of Blackrock and their rise to a major world power in the 21st century.

I'm sure all of us that weren't 3 years old at the time remember the 2008 financial crisis. So many companies were devasted,
yet BlackRock massively profited in one of their first displays of corruption.
